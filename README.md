## How to play the game ?
On the homescreen, press "Space" to open the game. You are the small ship on the top left of the screen. Your goal is to pick up people at the different harbors and smuggle them safely to the other side. Beware of the coast guards ! They will appear continuously.
You have dfferent powerups, one to increase the cargo space and one to increase the speed. You can also buy auto-guided missiles. Press E to launch one of them. They target your closest ennemy at the moment.
